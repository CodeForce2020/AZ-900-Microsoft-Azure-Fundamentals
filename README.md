## Exam AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals - Skills Measured

- [AZ-900 Exam Skills Outline](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE3VwUY)

## Audience Profile: 
Candidates for this exam should have foundational knwoledge of cloud services and how those services are provided with Microsoft Azure. 

Azure Fundamentals exam is an opportunity to prove knowledge of cloud concepts, core Azure
services, Azure pricing, SLA, and lifecycle, and the fundamentals of cloud security, privacy,
compliance, and trust.

This exam is intended for people beginning to work with cloud-based solutions and services.

Candidates should be able to demonstrate a fundamental knowledge of cloud concepts, as well
as Azure services, workloads, security, privacy, pricing, and support. In addition, you should be
familiar with concepts of networking, storage, compute, application support, and application
development.

Azure Fundamentals can be used to prepare for other Azure role-based or specialty
certifications, but it is not a prerequisite for any of them.
